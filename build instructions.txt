Dependencies

ALL PLATFORMS

Squeezelite-R2 requires header files for the following libraries to be present at 
build time: * libasound2 * libflac * libmad0 * libvorbis * libfaad * libmpg123

All above libraries are dynamically loaded and optional at runtime, meaning that 
these libraries are only required on the build machine.

It also optionally supports the following libraries which may be enabled by 
defining additional build options: * libsoxr * libffmpeg

DEBIAN LINUX:

with alsa support (*):

Depends: libasound2 
Depends: libavcodec56  
Depends: libavcodec-extra-56  
Depends: libavformat56  
Depends: libavutil54  
Depends: libc6  
Depends: libfaad2  
Depends: libflac8  
Depends: libmad0  
Depends: libmpg123-0  
Depends: libsoxr0  
Depends: libvorbisfile3 

(*) PLEASE NOTE: DSD option require ALSA >= 1.0.29 to work.
Debian jessie 'stable' is not a candidate, works in Ubuntu 16.04LTS.

with portaudio support:

Depends: libportaudio2 
Depends: libavcodec56  
Depends: libavcodec-extra-56  
Depends: libavformat56  
Depends: libavutil54  
Depends: libc6  
Depends: libfaad2  
Depends: libflac8  
Depends: libmad0  
Depends: libmpg123-0  
Depends: libsoxr0  
Depends: libvorbisfile3

OSX

Include-osx contains the headers needed to build, tested from 10.7 to .

You need a valid version of portaudio.a (static library)  in 
./lib_osx folder.

WINDOWS

See squeezelite.vcxproj for dependencies in Windows.

You should provide statics libraries as needed by other platform 

Build Options

Optional build options are enabled by passing additional defines to the compiler. 
This may be done with the -D option to ggc or via setting OPTS before calling the 
included makefiles. For example:

OPTS="-DFFMPEG -DRESAMPLE" make

The following build options are supported:

* PORTAUDIO - build with port audio support (on linux only, it is not optional on other platforms) 
* RESAMPLE - build with libsoxr support for real time upsampling 
* FFMPEG - build with FFMPEG support for wma and alac support. Note that this requires the binary to be run 
with FFMPEG library versions which match the header files used for compilation. 
This is necessary and the ffmpeg api changes between versions. 
* VISEXPORT - support export of audio data to jivelite for visualization support (linux only) 
* DSD - support of DSD playback via 'natives' formats when possible or DOP.  

Target Platforms

Squeezelite-R2 can builds on debian linux, osx using included makefiles:

- Makefile.debian (*)
- Makefile.osx

It also builds using MSVC++ (tested with MSVC2010) on Windows (use squeezelite.vcxproj).

Above versions are used to build the binary versions attached to each release.

- Makefile.pa
- Makefile.resample

are just example on how to enable additiona features in linux.

To produce your own makefile, set options and flags for your platform, specify 
the executable name and include Makefile.

To build on linux with support i.e for resampling if the same tree was previously 
used to build with different options:

OPTS=-DRESAMPLE make clean

OPTS=-DRESAMPLE make

Other Makefiles are provvided and tested by different users, they worked when added, 
but are not tested by me on every new releases, so they should work but may not.

here the list, please reports errors, or new you wish to add, using issues in gitHub.
 
- Makefile.freebsd

  Produced by: Triode (?)
  First relased in version: 1.8 (?)
  Modified by: Simone Filippini (info@simonefilippini.it)
  Last release was reported as working: 1.8.4 by Simone Filippini (info@simonefilippini.it)

- Makefile.rpi (*)
  
  Produced by: Ralph Irving (?)

  First relased in version: 1.8 (?)
  Last release was reported as working: 1.8.4 by Simone Filippini (info@simonefilippini.it)
  Reported as non working in release: never
  Status: Working

  NOTES:
  It works for RPI2, needs adjustments in FLAGS for RPI or RPI3.
  DSD Works in Ubuntu non in raspbian (*).

- Makefile.raspbsd

  Produced by: Simone Filippini (info@simonefilippini.it)
  First relased in version: 1.8.4
  Last release was reported as working: 1.8.4

- Makefile.osx-i386 (osx is dual arch, this is i386 only)

  Produced by: Ralph Irving (?)
  First relased in version: 1.8 (?)
  Last release was reported as working: 1.8 (?)
  Reported as non working in release: 1.8.4 by Simone Filippini (info@simonefilippini.it)
  Status: obsolete.
  
  NOTES: 
  Makefie.osx produces an executable with double arch, so it's portable both on 
  i386 and x86_64 machines. This one is not needed anymore.
